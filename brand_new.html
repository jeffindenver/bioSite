                    If there were a contest for the biggest talker in the state of Nebraska, Paul Staehlin would win. 
                    He’s got the gift of gab and a silver tongue. And while he’s silver-tongued, he’s not a silver-tongued-devil. 
                    Instead, he’s understanding, approachable, and a pretty cool boss. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Paul’s current goals include preparing for retirement. “The kids are out of the house, so we’re focused on us,” 
                    he said about himself and his wife, Linda. Part of the retirement plan includes buying a new house as an investment, 
                    which he says will give a better return than stocks and bonds. He and Linda would also like to travel around 
                    the country in a brand new RV. “If I got a job that allowed me to work remotely, I’d do it in a heartbeat,” he said.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Some hurdles stand in the path to retirement. “You are your kids’ safety net, and you have to be prepared for 
                    anything,” he said. Also, time is ticking away, and the Staehlins’ house-buying plans are late by about 10 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Among Paul’s achievements are reaching his 10 year anniversary as EMS Inc.’s Director of Operations. He also served 
                    seven and a half years in the United States Air Force at an Air Force Base in the UK. There, they maintained medium 
                    range nuclear cruise missiles during the cold war. He was also able to progress in his career despite being a year 
                    away from a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science.

                <p>
                    From here, time and discipline are all he needs. Perhaps ten years from now, Paul will be sharing his Gift of Gab 
                    with the residents of Arizona as he and his wife, Linda, drive into the sunset in a brand new RV.
